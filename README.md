# üò∑ Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning and Python

A real-time face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), OpenCV, and TensorFlow. The model classifies whether a person is wearing a **mask**, **no mask** in both real-time video and static images. This project is deployed via **Streamlit** for interactive use.

## üîç Project Description

This project aims to promote public health awareness by detecting face mask usage in real-time scenarios. Using deep learning techniques with a traditional CNN model (no transfer learning), it processes image data and outputs mask-wearing status.

## üéØ Objectives

- Learn image classification using CNNs.
- Build a face mask classification model with TensorFlow.
- Train the model using labeled image data.
- Implement real-time detection using OpenCV.
- Deploy using Streamlit for user-friendly interaction.
